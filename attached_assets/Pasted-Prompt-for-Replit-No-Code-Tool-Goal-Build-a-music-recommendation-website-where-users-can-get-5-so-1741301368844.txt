Prompt for Replit No-Code Tool
Goal:
Build a music recommendation website where users can get 5 song recommendations and 3 playlist recommendations per day. After exceeding these limits, they will need to create an account. Additionally, display a pop-up showing the most played song on YouTube from trending categories (hip-hop, pop, and rock).

Step 1: User Interaction and Daily Limit Setup
Create Music Preferences Input:

Add a text input field where users can type their music preferences (e.g., "I want a chill 90s hip-hop playlist").
Add a "Get Recommendations" button that triggers the AI to generate song/playlist recommendations.
Track Usage for Unregistered Users:

Create a database (e.g., Supabase) to store daily usage (song and playlist limits).
Set a limit of 5 song recommendations and 3 playlist recommendations per day per unregistered user.
Once the user exceeds the limit, show a message: "You've reached your daily limit. Please create an account to continue."
Step 2: AI Integration (Using OpenAI API)
Integrate OpenAI API to generate playlist and song recommendations based on the user’s input.
Send user’s music preferences (e.g., "chill 90s hip-hop") to the OpenAI API.
Parse the response into song lists (with links to YouTube, Apple Music, and Spotify) and playlist recommendations.
Step 3: Authentication and Database Management
Add User Authentication (Supabase or another authentication service):

Allow users to sign up and log in using their email/password or OAuth (Google/Facebook).
Store user data (e.g., song and playlist usage limits).
Registered users can get unlimited recommendations or higher daily limits.
Track User’s Song and Playlist Recommendations:

For each user (both registered and unregistered), store the number of song and playlist recommendations they’ve used that day.
Reset the counts at the beginning of each day.
Step 4: Display Recommendations and Links
Show Recommendations:
Once the AI generates a playlist or song, display the list with links to YouTube, Apple Music, and Spotify.
Sign-Up Prompt:
After exceeding the free recommendation limit, show a prompt with a button to create an account.
After successful registration, reset their limits and allow unlimited access (or higher limits).
Step 5: Save Playlists for Registered Users
Allow Registered Users to Save Playlists:
After generating a playlist, allow logged-in users to save it to their profile.
Display a “Saved Playlists” section in their profile page.
Step 6: Trending Song Pop-Up
Use YouTube API (YouTube Data API v3) to fetch the most played songs from YouTube trending in the hip-hop, pop, and rock categories.

Use the videos.list endpoint to fetch the top trending videos in these genres.
Filter by category IDs (e.g., Hip-Hop, Pop, Rock).
Display Pop-Up with Trending Song:

Show a pop-up or modal with the current most-played song and a link to the YouTube video.
The pop-up should display:
The song name and artist.
A YouTube thumbnail and a link to the YouTube video.
Example: “Trending Now: ‘[Song Name]’ by [Artist Name]! [Watch on YouTube]”.
